        <h2>About</h2>

        <p> Child Rights and You commonly abbreviated as CRY, is a Non-governmental organization, which aims to restore children's rights. CRY partners with grassroots level non-governmental organisations

		to uplift thousands of underprivileged Indian children denied of basic rights by working across levels - from direct action, advocacy, mobilising public opinion to policy change. CRY identifies projects 

		across the country and funds the sincere efforts of many individuals and groups who work at a local and regional level and directly interact with the children to ensure happy, healthy and creative childhoods. </p>
