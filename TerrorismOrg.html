        <h2>About</h2>

        <p> The National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC) is a proposed federal anti-terror agency to be created in India, modelled on the National Counterterrorism Center of the USA. The proposal arose 

		after the 2008 Mumbai attacks a.k.a. 26/11 attacks where several intelligence and operational failures revealed the need for a federal agency with real time intelligence inputs of actionable 

		value specifically to counter terrorist acts against India. </p>

        <h2>Structure and Functions</h2>

        <p>The NCTC will derive its powers from the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967. It is to be a part of the Intelligence Bureau and will be headed by a Director who will report to the Director IB 

		and the Home Secretary. But the modified original draft of NCTC says that this system does not come under purview of Intelligence Beaureu and states are taken into confidence before the centre carries 

		on any operation in their territories. The NCTC will execute counter-terror operations and collect, collate and disseminate data on terrorism besides maintaining a data base on terrorists and their 

		associates including their families. The NCTC has been empowered to analyse intelligence shared by agencies like the Intelligence Bureau and select what it deems suitable. It has also been granted powers 

		to conduct searches and arrests in any part of India and will formulate responses to terror threats</p>

        <h2>Strategies</h2>

        <p>Addressing the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism</p>

        <p>To consistently, unequivocally and strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes, as it constitutes one of the most 

		serious threats to international peace and security.</p>



        <p>Measures to build statesâ€™ capacity to prevent and combat terrorism and to strengthen the role of the United Nations system in that regard</p>

        <p>Measures to ensure respect for human rights for all and the rule of law as the fundamental basis for the fight against terrorism.</p>
